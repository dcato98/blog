Hi there, I'm David, and welcome to my experimental blogspace. 

I'm currently looking for opportunities to build AI-powered tools as a machine learning engineer (or similar), especially those that aim to improve human communication, connection, learning, and insight. I intend to expand on my goals in a future post.

I plan on using this as a place to highlight a few of my my projects, tutorials, lists, and other thoughts. I would love to hear what you think. Get in touch with me on LinkedIn: [david-cato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cato/) or Twitter: [@dcato98](https://twitter.com/dcato98).

Thank you especially to [@hamelsmu](https://github.com/hamelsmu) for your work building this tool and also to [@1littlecoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0boq3zqazI&feature=youtu.be) for your video which made an already simple setup process even easier!
